# Starsiege Tribes 1 Docker Server
## Installation
A very basic docker-compose file is included, just change the environment variables to your liking and run `sudo docker-compose up -d --build` and you're off to the races.

For a full list of environment variables you can look at the section within the `Dockerfile` labelled for server config. Change these how you want

## Additions
Spoonbot 1.3 and Renegades 3 are both included
TODO: I want to get Renegades 5 working with spoonbot but currently it won't

## Information
I've included the master servers I know are working as of this date. I may in the future include a docker container to run your own master server as well.
